# Stock Price Prediction (SARIMAX)

This repository contains the code for a stock price prediction application using the SARIMAX time series forecasting model.

## Overview

This project aims to predict future stock prices based on historical data using the SARIMAX model. It allows a user to select a date within the dataset's range and make predictions for a specified forecasting horizon.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The core programming language.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **Statsmodels:** For time series modeling (SARIMAX).
*   **Scikit-learn (sklearn):** For evaluation metrics.
*   **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web application.
*   **Matplotlib:** For plotting results.

## Dataset

The data used for this project comes from the file `yahoo_stock.csv`. It's expected to have a 'Date' column as the index and a 'Close' column containing the closing stock prices.
